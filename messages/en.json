        "solution": "A custom-built website with an animated 3D neon figure in the hero section, glitch-style typography, a scrolling marquee, an embedded aftermovie from the 2023 edition, and a dedicated ticket subdomain (tickets.examen.wtf).

        "solution": "We built a corporate website that positions MS-PROD as a premium partner rather than just a vendor. The design language was crafted to reflect the intensity of live production — authoritative, bold, and confident.

The platform handles the full competition flow — from QR-code-gated voting to live results displayed on screens — with anti-fraud measures and a full admin panel to control the process.",
        "challenge": "Live audience voting is notoriously easy to exploit. The client needed a system that felt fast and frictionless for guests scanning QR codes, while preventing duplicate votes, supporting two competition rounds, and giving the organizer full real-time control over the event flow.",
        "solution": "We built a Next.js app backed by Supabase with real-time subscriptions. Votes are protected by FingerprintJS to prevent duplicates without requiring accounts. Round 1 collects votes from all DJs, then the top two advance to Round 2. Separate results screens update live for the audience, while the admin panel lets organizers start/stop rounds, reset data, and monitor progress in real time.",
        "result": "A smooth, fraud-resistant voting experience that kept the audience engaged throughout the event. The organizer had full control from the admin panel, and the live results screens created a genuinely exciting moment when the winner was revealed."

    "intro": "If you've been thinking about creating a landing page for your business in Moldova — you're probably already tired of cookie-cutter answers like 'a landing page is a one-page website that sells.' Thanks, we already know that. Let's get into what actually matters, with real examples and zero marketing fluff.",
    "sections": {
      "why": {
        "title": "Why you need a landing page when you already have Instagram",
        "content": "Honestly? Instagram is fine. But it has one major downside: you don't control the funnel. Someone opens your profile, scrolls a bit, sees their friend's cat — and leaves.\n\nA landing page is your turf. Here, you guide the customer by hand: from the headline to the 'Submit' button. No distractions, no recommendation feeds.\n\nAt GoQode, we work with businesses in Chișinău and Moldova and see the same story: a company spends €500–1,000/month on Facebook ads driving traffic to their Instagram profile. Conversion: 1–2%. The same traffic to a proper landing page delivers 5–8%. The math is simple."

        "list": [
          "First screen — a concrete offer. Not 'best solutions for your business,' but 'Water delivery in Chișinău in 40 minutes. First bottle free.' A person needs to understand what you offer within 3 seconds.",
          "Social proof near the offer. Not at the bottom of the page where nobody sees it, but right under the headline. '150+ clients in Chișinău' or real company logos.",
          "One target action. Not 'call us / write on WhatsApp / submit a request / subscribe.' One button. One goal.",
          "A 'how it works' block with 3–4 steps. People fear the unknown. Show that the process is simple.",
          "Real case studies or reviews. Not 'John D., director.' Concrete results."

Decent design, responsive layout, basic SEO.\n\n— Professional development (what we do): €690–2,000. Custom design, conversion-optimized structure, speed optimization, analytics, A/B testing.\n\nThe real question isn't 'how much does a landing page cost,' but 'how much will it earn you.' A €200 page with 1% conversion vs a €1,000 page with 5% — the difference isn't €800, it's dozens of customers every month."
